geotrans
========

NGA doesn't provide versioned sources of the library, meaning that with each new release existing sources for old
releases will be lost and builds will no longer be reproducible (original issue and rationale: https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/pull/6512).

This folder contains snapshots of the sources as they are retrieved from `https://earth-info.nga.mil/php/download.php?file=wgs-mastertgz`:

 * `geotrans-3.8.tgz`: retrieved on 2021-10-13
