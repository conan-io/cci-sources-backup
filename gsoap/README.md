gSOAP
=====

As of today, only the latest version of gSOAP sources can be downloaded from Sourceforge (https://sourceforge.net/projects/gsoap2/files/),
it breaks existing recipes in ConanCenter (old revisions) and makes it impossible to maintain
a [working recipe for gSOAP](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/tree/master/recipes/gsoap).

This folder contains snapshots of the sources as they are in the [repository](https://sourceforge.net/p/gsoap2/code/commit_browser).

 * `r186`: 2.8.103
 * `r187`: 2.8.104
 * `r188`: 2.8.105
 * `r189`: 2.8.106
