# cci-sources-backup

Temporal solution for sources that are no longer accessible. This repository
will serve as a public place to _store_ sources that are used by 
[ConanCenter recipes](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index) but now
are no longer accessible.

It doesn't invalidate the [packaging policy](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/blob/master/docs/packaging_policy.md),
it only tries to bypass the issue with recipes that has stopped to work because
of this reason.

A more general and robust solution will be released in the following months.


> **Note.-** **Do not use these sources.** We might remove, rename, move or change them
> without previous notice.
